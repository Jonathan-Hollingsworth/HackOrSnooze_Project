# HackOrSnooze_Project
(This is NOT the Hack or Snooze API)  
This project uses the official Hack or Snooze API to replicate the Hacker News website  
##  
You are able to create an account and create (and delete) your own stories 
as well as mark stories from others as favorites  
  
The code utilized in (un)favoriting and deleting stories is found in the User class within models.js  
(main.js is only for defining constants and initialization)  
##
Upon favoriting adding or deleting a story you must reload the page in order for the changes to take full effect  
You can also see when certain functions are taking effect by opening the console (ctrl + shift + j)
